# Method: Change Gear

This method changes the gear by performing checks to find when this change needs to occur.

```py
    def change_gear() {

      # if self.speed is between 0 - 10 self.gear is 1
      # if self.speed is between 10 - 20 self.gear is 2
      # if self.speed is between 20 - 30 self.gear is 3
      # if self.speed is between 30 - 45 self.gear is 4
      # if self.speed is 45+ self.gear is 5  
    }
```
