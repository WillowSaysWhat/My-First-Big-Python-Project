# Load Simulation

This method pulls the text commands from `simulation.txt` and stores them in the list provided. This is the method that performs the critical task for the sim to work correctly. 

```py
    def load_simualtion(self, filename):

        # open filestream using filename variable
        # pull text from file
        # loop over and append text to list
        # close filestream.
         
```
