# Run Simulation

This method loops over the list and executes the corresponding method. For example, if the command is `ACCELERATE` the method will run the accelerate method to either +5 or -5 depending on parameters.

```py
    def accelerate():

        # if the car is moving FORWARD then +5
        # if the car is in REVERSE the -5

```
