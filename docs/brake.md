# Method: Brake

This method changes the speed variable by +5 when in FORWARD and  -5 when in REVERSE. It is executed when the `BRAKE` command is accepted.
```py
        def brake() {
            # check if broken

            # self.speed plus 5
            # self.speed minus 5

            # check gear change
        }
```
