# My First Big Python Project
## A beginner project for Python

This is a beginner Python project for coders who want to complete their first ever "big" project.

In the coming weeks you will:

* Code and execute a working car simulator.
* Upload it to Git Hub.
* Create a README.md for your finished project.
* Expand your README into a wiki.
* Do the whole project yourself without a full tutorial.

The table below will navigate you to topics that will be covered in the project. Focus on learning the concept and implementing it yourself. Stay away from Chat-Jipperty if you can.
